# AntiAntiXray
For the annoying server owners that add an anti xray plugin.

## Notice
For every plugin dev reading this, you basically cant fix this unless you want everyone on the server to gain riches off fake blocks that suddently become real ;)

## Usage
To scan nearby blocks in selected radius, press `G` ingame.

To remove a block for testing, creating a ghost block, press `V` ingame.
